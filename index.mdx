## Overview

The Global Connect API enables partners to create dynamic, multi-step onboarding flows for customers enrolling in energy grid services programs. Each session automatically generates the appropriate steps based on transmission region, customer classification, and program requirements.

## Key Features

## How It Works

The Global Connect API uses a session-based workflow:

1. **Create a session** with transmission region, customer classification, and optional program identifier
2. **Collect customer data** by updating the session context with field values
3. **Validate each step** to ensure all requirements are met before advancing
4. **Advance through steps** - the API automatically skips steps with pre-populated fields
5. **Track completion** - query connection status after enrollment is finished

## Core Concepts

### Sessions

A session represents a single customer onboarding journey. Sessions maintain state through:
- **Context**: Accumulated field values collected from the customer
- **Current Step**: The active step requiring user input
- **Agreements**: Status of required customer agreements
- **Status**: Lifecycle state (IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, CLOSED)

### Dynamic Steps

Steps are generated dynamically based on program requirements. For example:
- PJM Capacity programs require different fields than ERCOT ERS programs
- Commercial customers may have different requirements than residential
- Steps with all required fields already populated are automatically skipped

### Context Accumulation

Field values accumulate in the session context as the user progresses. Context is:
- Merged with each update (new values supplement existing ones)
- Protected by ETag concurrency control to prevent conflicts
- Validated against step requirements before advancement

## API Organization

The API is organized into five main areas:
